/*
* We have covered a lot this week. This week's example
* will build all this together. We will create a program
* which builds on the previous week's example.
*
* Our program will declare a macro named MAX_SUSHI and set 
* it to a size of 10. Then, we will create an int array of that size
* which will store our user's orders. Once the user has exited the menu
* OR the order array is full, we will print the order list
* back to the user.
