/*
* In this lab, we will be practicing more with functions and 
* pointers. The first function will take two arguments:
* one character array and one integer; it will check to see
* if the amount of characters in the array match the integer
* and will return 1 or 0 depending on if it is true or false.

* The second basic function will take a character array as its
* only argument and return nothing. We will take user input and 
* store it in the character array.

* Then, we will write a main function and experiment with these
* functions.

* Hint:     scanf("%[^\n]",arr);getchar();
