/*
* Starting this week, we will be using header files
* as well!
*
* We will take our functions from the sushi example we've
* been rolling with and organize the functions and forward
* declarations into a header and c file. 
*
* Furthermore, we're going to see where we can save memory
* with pointers and really nail down how they work.
